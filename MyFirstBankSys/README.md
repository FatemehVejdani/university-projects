# MyFirstBankSys

A beginner-level desktop banking management system built with Python and PyQt5.  
This project was developed as a university assignment during my first month of learning Python — without any help from AI tools like ChatGPT — just through YouTube tutorials and independent research.

**Completed:** Fall 1401, Term 1 — Computer Engineering
